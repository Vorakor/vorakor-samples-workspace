    <p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead">
        A form generator for all of your dynamic needs! Simply give it configurations and define
        your inputs, give it your formGroup variable, and add data and Ngx Dynamic Forms will handle
        the rest.
    </p>
    <p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead">
        Ngx Dynamic Forms currently features horizontal and vertical configured forms, as well as
        submit and reset functionality, form controls can be passed in with custom validation as
        well. There are two interfaces to make use of to accomplish configuration and to designate
        fields and input structure, these are ngx-df-configuration and ngx-df-field-definition.
    </p>
    <p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead">
        Ngx Dynamic Forms also has the ability to handle dynamic data, if you are unsure of how many
        inputs or rows you will need, you won't even need to think about it anymore, and if someone
        adds a new row without telling you, no worries there either, Ngx Dynamic Forms will adapt
        and add in new rows dynamically as long as you've done your homework and set it up properly.

                <p class="grey-text">
                    The idea with the horizontal form is that all elements are on one line. Typical
                    use cases for this include search functionality in the header bar.

                    Vertical forms are the most common forms, and basically it means that each input
                    has it's own line. Typical use cases include sign-in forms.
